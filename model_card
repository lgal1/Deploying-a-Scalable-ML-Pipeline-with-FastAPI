# Model Card

## Model Details:
- Person/Organization developing model: Laurie Galler/WGU Student
– Model date: 8/9/2025
– The Model version: Python 3.8, scikit-learn 1.2.
– The Model type was sklearn.linear_model: LogisticRegression.
- The Training setting was set at a high level.
    -solver="liblinear", max_iter=1000, random_state=42
    Label (<=50 vs >50)

## Intended Use
- The Primary intended use is to predict if an individual's income is more that $50K based on the census data.
– The Primary intended user is for students studying to be data scientists and studying Machine Learning DevOps Udacity.
– Out-of-scope use cases would be to automate credit decisions without intervention and human oversight.

## Training Data
- The source for the data is the UCI Adult Census Income Dataset - census.csv.
- Features in the data set are:
    Categorical:
        - Workclass, Education, Marital Status, Occupation, Relationship, Race, Sex, Native Country
    Numerical: 
        - Age, Hours-per-week
- Label: Salary had two class, one of greater than 50K and one of equal to or less than 50K.

## Evaluation Data
– The datasets were split. One of training that was 80 percent. On of testing that was 20 percent.
– The motivation was based on the salary.
– Preprocessing was done in the process_data and used the pipline implemented in the train_model.py using helpers from model.py.

## Metrics
- The metrics were tested using a default threshold of 0.5. 
- The overall test performance for precision was 0.7191. The recall was 0.2742. The F1 score was 0.3970. 
 - Some examples of the Slice Performance Output below:

workclass: Federal-gov, Count: 195
Precision: 0.6250 | Recall: 0.1974 | F1: 0.3000
----------------------------------------
workclass: Local-gov, Count: 389
Precision: 0.7297 | Recall: 0.2250 | F1: 0.3439
----------------------------------------
workclass: Never-worked, Count: 1
Precision: 1.0000 | Recall: 1.0000 | F1: 1.0000
----------------------------------------
workclass: Private, Count: 4,597
Precision: 0.6992 | Recall: 0.2696 | F1: 0.3891
----------------------------------------
workclass: Self-emp-inc, Count: 222
Precision: 0.9556 | Recall: 0.3644 | F1: 0.5276
----------------------------------------
– The decision threshold is > than 50K for the salary.
– Variation approach did not apply due to a hard set threshold set at 50K for the salary.

## Ethical Considerations
- There are some ethical condisderations such as potential bias in gender or race due to the historical daataset.
- The metrics showed a higher precision but had a lower recall. This can miss some positive cases and should include some fairness checks.

## Caveats and Recommendations
- The main recommentations is that the dataset is 11 years old and outdated. Most likely does not represent today's demographics. It is recommended to retain updated data.
